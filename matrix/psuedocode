create two 100x00 matrices with +/- values
initialize threadCount = 10 to increment number of threads
use executor service? https://crunchify.com/how-to-run-multiple-threads-concurrently-in-java-executorservice-approach/
want to start at 1 thread:


thread algorithm:
	find unlocked result slot
	obtain lock
	compute and store result
	if no more unlocked, exit


Matrix Object:
vars:
int rposition
int cposition
______________
methods:
void lockResult(rposition, cposition) 
boolean getNext(rposition, cposition)
